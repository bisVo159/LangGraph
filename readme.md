# LangGraph Experiments

This project is a playground for learning and experimenting with [LangGraph](https://github.com/bisVo159/LangGraph), [LangChain](https://github.com/bisVo159/GENERATIVE_AI), and building agentic AI workflows in Python.

## Whatâ€™s Inside

- **LangGraph & LangChain Demos:** Example notebooks and scripts showing how to use LangGraph for stateful, agentic AI flows.
- **Cool AI Agents:** Experiments with building and chaining AI agents for tasks like joke generation, explanation, and more.
- **Persistence & Fault Tolerance:** Examples of saving and resuming workflow state, time travel, and updating state mid-execution.

## Getting Started

1. **Clone this repo**
2. **Create a virtual environment**
   ```sh
   python -m venv myenv
   ```
3. **Activate the environment**
   - On Windows:
     ```sh
     myenv\Scripts\activate
     ```
   - On macOS/Linux:
     ```sh
     source myenv/bin/activate
     ```
4. **Install dependencies**
   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

5. **Set up environment variables**
   - Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and fill in your API keys (e.g., for Google Generative AI).

6. **Run the notebooks**
   - Open `.ipynb` files in VS Code or Jupyter Lab.

## Project Goals

- Learn and document LangGraph features
- Build and test agentic AI workflows
- Explore persistence, fault tolerance, and state management
